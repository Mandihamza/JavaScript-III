/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*


* 1. Window Binding - Unless stated otherwise the default binding of `this` is to the window/console object.


* 2. Implicit Binding - Implicit binding means that the `this` keyword refers to the object to the left of the dot. (Dot Notation)


* 3. New Binding - When `this` is used with constructor functions, this referes to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function. It actually creates brand new objects -- hence the name 'Constructor Function'. For example, if you pass 3 parameters to the constructor function such as breed, name, and type, and then invoke a function with the *new* keyword `this` will be bound to those three objects (this.breed, this.name, this.type).


* 4. Explicit Binding -  Implicit binding refers to whatever is left of the dot (dot notation). For example:
